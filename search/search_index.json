By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.</p> <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p> <p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p> <p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.</p> <p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.</p> <p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.</p> <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>"},{"location":"about/license/#terms-and-conditions","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS","text":""},{"location":"about/license/#0-definitions","title":"0.

ReactJS React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like <code>Thumbnail</code>, <code>LikeButton</code>, and <code>Video</code>. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps. MUI Move faster with intuitive React UI tools. MUI offers a comprehensive suite of free UI tools to help you ship new features faster. Start with Material UI, our fully-loaded component library, or bring your own design system to our production-ready components. Docker Accelerate how you build, share, and run applications. Docker helps developers build, share, and run applications anywhere \u2014 without tedious environment configuration or management. Celery Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system. It\u2019s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling. Celery Beat This extension enables you to store the periodic task schedule in your database. The periodic tasks can be managed from the Django Admin interface, where you can create, edit and delete periodic tasks and how often they should run. Django Rest Framework Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. MapLibre Open-source mapping libraries for web and mobile app developers. deck.gl is a WebGL-powered framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets. PostGIS PostGIS extends the capabilities of the PostgreSQL relational database by adding support storing, indexing and querying geographic data. PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. Tegola An open source vector tile server written in Go, Tegola takes geospatial data and slices it into vector tiles that can be efficiently delivered to any client. GDAL GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an MIT style Open Source License by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats.
